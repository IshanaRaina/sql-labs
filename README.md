# SQL

Data is everywhere! And SQL (or a flavor of SQL) is the language used to interact with the top 4 out of 5 database management systems at the time of writing according to [db-engines](https://db-engines.com/en/ranking_trend). In case you were wondering, SQL stands for **S**ructured **Q**uery **L**anguage or in other words, writing queries against structured data which is exactly what we have in store for you!

## Let's Get Started

### Core SQL

This module deals with the core concepts of SQL. Its goal is to get you familiar enough with the language to where you're comfortable interacting with any structured database and can query it to retrieve meaningful information.

- [Section 3](core-sql/section-3.md): Subqueries
- [Section 4](core-sql/section-4.md): Analytic functions
- [Section 5](core-sql/section-5.md): Oracle metadata

### PL/SQL

Want to take your SQL skills to the next level? Add procedural elements to your queries! The PL in PL/SQL stands for **P**rocedural **L**anguage and is the procedural extension of SQL supported by the Oracle database management system.
